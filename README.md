# Hooks API

To Do List Manager Phase 1: Begin the build of an application designed for creating and organizing a “To Do” list in your browser.

## Overview

Today, we begin the first of a 4-phase build of the To Do List Manager, a web-based task manager application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup a foundational system using React hooks that we can build upon in later phases, adding databases, logins, and more advanced features.

## Features

- Class Based Components converted to Functional Components
- Styling and layout performed with React Bootstrap Components
- Current functionality works unchanged
- State managed using `useState()`
- `useEffect()` used to change the title of the browser to show to dos remaining
- To do items pre-loaded using `useEffect()`
- Provided mock-up design matched 
- `react-bootstrap` components and theming used

## Process

Repository created. Create-react-app used to create project folder. Folder loaded into repository. Starter code copied into files of repository. Refactored todo.js first, then form.js and finally list.js. All three files converted to use hooks and use functions to replace classes. Code written to extend features to delete items from list. Bootstrap installed and bootstrap components used to style parts of all three files.

App deployed on Netlify.
